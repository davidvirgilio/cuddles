## Welcome to Cuddles Repository

Here, you can find all the files related to my project. This is a full-stack deployment, and you can find most of the external resources' interactions in the /src/app/api/ folder. Unfortunately, it's not possible to easily run a Codespace since you will need your own credentials and accounts.

I used the following services to develop this application:
- React.js as JavaScript framework.
- SASS as CSS pre-processor
- AWS for image storage.
- MongoDb as the database service.
- Next.js as the React builder.
- Vercel for deployment.
- Git and Github for version control.
